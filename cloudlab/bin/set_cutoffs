# This script sets the cutoffs for unscheduled priorities on one or more
# nodes to match the characteristics of the Homa workloads.
#
# Usage:
# set_cutoffs workload num_nodes [first]
#
# The "workload" argument must be one of w1-w5; the cutoffs will be set
# to values appropriate for that workload. The "num_nodes" arguments indicates
# how many servers should be updated. The "first" argument is optional; it
# is an integer identifying the first node on which installation will occur
# (e.g. "set_cutoffs w3 4 2" means node-2 through node-5 will be updated.
# "first" defaults to 0.
