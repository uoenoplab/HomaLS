# Kill processes with a given name on a cluster of machines.
#
# Usage:
# ckill name num_nodes [first]
#
# "name" gives the name of the process to be killed (suitable as an
# argument to "pidof"). The "num_nodes" arguments indicates how many
# servers should be examined for processes to kill. The "first" argument
# is optional; it is an integer identifying the first node on which
# killing will occur (e.g. "ckill cp_node 4 2" means node-2 throughnode-5 will be 
# updated will be searched. "first" defaults to 0.
